    - multiple groups can be selected (spacebar) using `gooseberry config group`
    - You can now filter by group ID(s) or group name(s) (comma separated) in all filterable commands

* first crates.io version

## [0.1.0] - 2020-11-28
First somewhat decent release!

Main commands:

* `gooseberry sync` - syncs hypothesis annotations to gooseberry
* `gooseberry search` - opens an interactive search buffer to select annotations. Has keyboard shortcuts to add tags,
  remove tags and delete annotations. This should be the main entrypoint for users while `gooseberry tag`
  , `gooseberry delete`, and `gooseberry view`
  are more for automating these tasks.
* `gooseberry make` - builds the mdbook knowledge base
* `gooseberry config` - manages configuration, view and edit Hypothesis credentials, the Hypothesis group, and the
  location of the knowledge base
* `gooseberry move` - move annotations from one group to another (**move** not copy). Useful if you have a bunch of
  annotations scattered around and want to move them into one group for gooseberry.
